<p>There has been quite a bit of fuss in the days since Apple started
rejecting apps that make use of the UDID. The deprecation was announced
months ago, but the rejection started without warning and was a surprise
to some. Firms that had been planning for the change typically already
had multiple secondary solutions in place, many of which rely on using
the Media Access Control (MAC) address from the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_network_interface_controller>wireless network
interface controller</a> (wireless NIC) on the device. There have since
been complaints that this is just as much of a privacy problem as using
the UDID that Apple banned access to (keep in mind, they still have
access to it), but these complaints demonstrate a lack of understanding
on what a MAC address is, why it exists, and most notably the fact that
it is transmitted in a plainly-readable form that can be viewed by every
other device on any network to which you are connected.</p>
<h3 id=some-background-on-mac-addresses class=anchor-link><a href=#some-background-on-mac-addresses>Some background on MAC addresses</a></h3>
<p>MAC stands for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_access_control>Media Access Control</a>, and it is a
special identifier that is assigned by the manufacturer to every NIC
inside electronic devices. In theory, every NIC in every device has a
unique MAC address assigned to it. This has been the case for decades,
so there is nothing new or revolutionary going on here. If you have a
laptop with an ethernet NIC (where you plug in a cable to get on a
network) and a wireless NIC (so that you can access wireless networks),
and a Bluetooth controller (for keyboards, mice, etc.) then your laptop
will have three distinct MAC addresses, one for each NIC. These MAC
addresses are used to route the information from your device to other
devices or points on the network. The MAC address is somewhat like a
return address written on a letter, and due to its importance for
network communication, it isn&rsquo;t going anywhere any time soon. Any time
you send any information over the network, say to access a web page,
check your email, or any other task, this information is broken up into
tiny chunks, and each chunk contains information about where it came
from and where it&rsquo;s going. Maybe a more concrete example would better
illustrate how this works.</p>
<p>Say you want to mail a big book to a friend. If you used the same method
to send the book that your electronic device uses to surf the web, then
you wouldn&rsquo;t just send one big book in one big box. What your
computer/iPhone/whatever does is splits the book into stacks of say, 20
pages. Then it puts each stack of pages into its own envelope and writes
your friend&rsquo;s address and the return address (yours), so that your
friend knows where the letter came from. It also writes a number on each
envelope so that your friend can reassemble the pages inside the
envelopes in the correct order and make sure that they received all the
envelopes required to reconstruct the complete book. People are not
shocked by the fact that anyone who happens to see one of the envelopes
will also see the addressing information that you wrote on them.</p>
<p>This process works just the same when electronic devices communicate.
The difference is that the address of the sender and recipient are not a
name, street, city, and country. They are other identifiers, one of
which is the MAC address of your NIC. In general these pieces of
information can be seen by everyone who is on the same network as you,
and in some cases even people outside your network. In order words, if
you are surfing the web on your phone using a wireless network in a
coffee shop, then everyone else who is connected to that wireless network
can see your MAC address, and you can see theirs too. It&rsquo;s 100%,
completely, public. It is not encrypted, anonymized, or otherwise
abstracted. The MAC address from your device is broadcasted as clear as
if you wrote it on a huge piece of paper and held it above your head.
Everyone could easily read it, and they&rsquo;d think you were crazy if you
yelled at them for doing so. They would probably already think you were
crazy for writing a MAC address on a huge piece of paper and holding it
over your head, but you get my point.</p>
<h3 id=the-privacy-problem class=anchor-link><a href=#the-privacy-problem>The Privacy Problem</a></h3>
<p>So then the question becomes, is making use of information someone has
publicized actually a privacy problem? I am guessing that most people
who are raising the privacy issue in relation to the usage MAC addresses
don&rsquo;t realize that the MAC address is being constantly broadcast by
their device any time they are doing anything on any network. User
privacy is important, and that&rsquo;s why I fully advocate that companies
making use of the MAC address should anonymize it first. By doing so
they are voluntarily protecting the user.</p>
<p>From the opposite perspective, there is no way to easily disable or
change a MAC address. You can pretend to have a different one, called
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_spoofing>MAC Spoofing</a>, but it isn&rsquo;t always easy or possible to do so. In that
sense, anyone who is using a device connected to some network doesn&rsquo;t
really have a choice in regards to the visibility of their MAC address.
The MAC address exists and has for decades, it&rsquo;s pretty much required in
order for most devices to communicate, and there is nothing you can
easily do to get rid of it. In that sense, using the MAC address as a
device identifier poses the same problems as the UDID.</p>
<p>The big problem here is something that is very common when technology
and privacy intersect. People don&rsquo;t understand the details of how the
technology works, and for the most part they don&rsquo;t really care. This
causes people to use features that probably aren&rsquo;t good for their
privacy even though they shouldn&rsquo;t. This ignorance also causes them to
freak out about things that don&rsquo;t really have as much of an impact on
their privacy, because they don&rsquo;t understand the technology and this
lack of understanding results in fear. They will go along happily using
their iPhone, checking in with Foursquare, which is cross-posted to
their Facebook (or they check in with Facebook directly), and they tweet
pictures with Instagram, and they think nothing of doing all of this. In
reality, they are giving away an amazing amount of information about who
they are, where they are, and what they are doing.</p>
<p>For example, if you are checking in with Facebook or Foursquare then
people know where you are and where you aren&rsquo;t. If you have personal
photos on your (likely public) Facebook profile then someone can easily
just go to wherever you are (since you checked in), wait for you to come
out (since they have your photo), and follow you around. They could
follow you home, wait until you leave again, see that you have checked
in at work, and proceed to steal all your possessions. People are
voluntarily sharing all these things, this data that could be formed
into a very real threat, and people seem to be perfectly comfortable
with that. Why? You could make the argument that people are comfortable
sharing so much information because they are choosing to do so, but
that&rsquo;s not really a good argument if the choice is not a well-informed
one. I would advise people to visit the <a href=https://www.eff.org>Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>
(EFF), which has a specific page set up for <a href=https://www.eff.org/issues/social-networks>social network privacy
and security</a>. As is often the case, the privacy argument all comes
down to user education. They never knew anything about MAC addresses,
and now they&rsquo;re unhappy that there is some unique token that is tied to
their device. They just didn&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s been this way all along.</p>
<h3 id=conclusion class=anchor-link><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>So using UDIDs is not possible anymore, and that isn&rsquo;t a bad thing. Many
companies have switched to alternative methods, including using an
anonymized version of the MAC address. The MAC address is a necessary
part of communication between networked devices and is readable by all
devices on the same network (and always has been), so taking the step to
anonymize it (which every company should) is actually a step up for user
privacy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to drive a car without license plates, you don&rsquo;t get to
send letters without writing an address on them, and you don&rsquo;t really
get to connect electronic devices to a network without a MAC address.
You do get to choose if you will drive, write letters, or surf the web,
and in these situations the user still does have the choice to opt-out.
Whether or not they feel the risks outweigh the benefits is something
only they can decide, but that decision should be an informed one. In
the meantime, companies making use of the MAC address should keep in
mind user privacy concerns, should always hash the MAC address so they
are not accessing the original, and should take all possible steps to
facilitate privacy and transparency for users.</p>
