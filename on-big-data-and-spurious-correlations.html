that the New York Times wrote an <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html>article on big data</a>, I think the
most interesting part was at the end:</p><blockquote><p>Big Data has its perils, to be sure. With huge data sets and
fine-grained measurement, statisticians and computer scientists
note, there is increased risk of false discoveries. The trouble
with seeking a meaningful needle in massive haystacks of data, says
Trevor Hastie, a statistics professor at Stanford, is that many
bits of straw look like needles. Big Data also supplies more raw
material for statistical shenanigans and biased fact-finding
excursions. It offers a high-tech twist on an old trick: I know the
facts, now lets find em. That is, says Rebecca Goldin, a
mathematician at George Mason University, one of the most
pernicious uses of data.</p></blockquote><p>The warning was embedded on the last page of a 3-page article, a mere 3
short paragraphs from the end. I understand that the piece was designed
to be rather lighthearted and to focus more on job opportunities that
are present in such a growing field, but more needs to be said about
this peril of analyzing very large sets of data.</p><p>Humans already have a long list of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases>cognitive biases</a>, which I call brain failures, that come
up in our daily lives. These brain failures have become increasingly
problematic along with the increase in access to information. Humans
love to find similarities between things, and those pattern recognition
skills are one thing that have allowed us to survive this long. If Ug
the caveman ate berries and then Ug got sick, he would assume that the
berries were the cause and therefore avoid them, thus potentially saving
him from illness and death. In this way, by natural selection, we have
evolved to become very sensitive to correlations that do not exist or
exist but do not have an effect on the situation under consideration.
This is especially apparent in the financial sector, where <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_relationship>spurious
relationships</a> abound. On the surface it can be pretty obvious that the
correlations are spurious, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop people from
demonstrating that they are supported by data.</p><p>For example, consider the
<a href=https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2010/01/28/super-bowl-indicator-says-stocks-to-rise/>Superbowl Indicator</a> which says that if an original NFL team wins the
Superbowl then stocks will rise in the coming year, and if not then they
will fall. This already sounds pretty ridiculous, but consider that it
also has a 79% accuracy rate. A perfect example of a spurious
correlation. There are other crazy correlative indicators of stock
market prices, like the <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sportsillustratedindicator.asp>Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue Indicator</a>,
which says that the stock market will have above-average returns in
years that an American model is on the cover of the Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit issue. The point is that as humans have the ability to amass
and analyze larger and larger sets of data, they will increasingly
discover correlations that are spurious, and data scientists or those
who work with &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; should be very aware of this problem.</p><p>At this
point the discipline is still occupied by those with a strong scientific
and mathematical background and therefore already have some
critical-thinking-based immunity to spurious correlations from training
or past exposure, but as tools and techniques for data analysis become
more accessible to the average person the problem of succumbing to
spurious correlations will be more pronounced. I&rsquo;m not scolding the New
York Times for not putting that at the beginning of their article, but I
think it would be good to put more emphasis on the careful analytical
skills required in &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; work.</p><a class=hidden href=https://brid.gy/publish/mastodon></a><a class=hidden href=https://brid.gy/publish/twitter></a><a class=hidden href=https://fed.brid.gy/></a><data class=p-bridgy-omit-link value=false></data></article></div><div id=webmentions></div></li></ul></section></main><hr><footer class="flex col"><section class="footer-bio content"><p><strong>Adam Drake</strong> leads technical business transformations in global and multi-cultural environments.
