Introduction It has been a couple of years since my last Project Eueler effort, An Unreasonably Deep Dive into Project Euler Problem 3, and since I&rsquo;ve also been wanting to do more work with Rust recently, I thought it would be a good opportunity to do both things at once by doing Project Euler problem 4 in Rust instead of my default of Go as before.

That event was designed to be a discussion around &ldquo;Rational AI in the Enterprise&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ve found that since then others have been interested in hosting a version of the lecture as well.
Recently, I updated the slides a bit and changed the focus of the lecture somewhat to make it more clear and accessible. I had a great opportunity to give version 2 of this lecture to a group organized by Army Futures Command.

In it, three levels of war are described. They are:
The strategic level (such as national policy) The operational level (such as campaigns and major operations) The tactical level (including battles and small-unit actions) At the strategic level, national interests and policy inform national and multinational military objectives, and global plans for achieving those objectives are developed.

I was very grateful for the opportunity.
The university&rsquo;s facilities were fantastic, and Ravi did a wonderful job organizing everything. The audience was engaging and asked thoughtful questions, and the attendance was much higher than I had anticipated for a Tuesday morning lecture in the middle of summer! There was great representation from multiple departments, including Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics.
