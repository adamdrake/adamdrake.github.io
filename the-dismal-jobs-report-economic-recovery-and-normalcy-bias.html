is reacting with shock and amazement at the negative June jobs report,
which showed that contrary to the 125,000 jobs that even the most
pessimistic economists expected to be added to the economy, the actual
number was in fact about 18,000. This isn&rsquo;t surprising, as this recovery
will take a long time. In fact, it will take longer than most people
expect and that is due in part to something called Normalcy Bias.</p><p>Normalcy bias is a cognitive bias which
is of particular interest, given the global financial crash that
occurred in 2008 and the ensuing recovery. The normalcy bias is a mental
state that is entered into when faced with a disaster and leads to
underestimation of the possibility that a disaster will occur, in
addition to underestimating the possible effects of the disaster itself.</p><p>The result of the normalcy bias is inadequate preparation for disasters
because there is a propensity to believe that such a disaster has never
occurred and therefore such a disaster will never occur. In addition, it
makes coping with the disaster exceedingly difficult once it starts.</p><p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the normalcy bias causes people to
interpret warnings as optimistically as possible by using ambiguities to
conclude that the situation is not as serious as it seems.</p><p>Consider the
<a href=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-tumble-on-weak-jobs-growth-2011-07-08>statement</a> from Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key
Private Bank, who said</p><blockquote><p>It was obviously a shock, although in
retrospect, I don&rsquo;t think we should be inordinately surprised by the
report considering the weakness in the second quarter.</p></blockquote><p>This is a
textbook example of optimistic interpretation of information due to
normalcy bias.</p><p>Another good example of the normalcy bias was seen during
Hurricane Katrina. Even after mandatory evacuation orders were given,
and the situation in New Orleans had become dire, there were thousands
of people who refused to evacuate the city. Many people in New Orleans
lost their lives because of their inability to overcome the normalcy
bias. They were simply convinced that everything would be fine.</p><p>Overcoming the normalcy bias can be difficult, since there is a fine
line between identifying and planning for potential issues and having a
constant doomsday attitude. In addition, many financial disasters are
difficult to predict and therefore accepting and adapting to conditions
is more important than identifying potential problems and planning for
them. In the case of the economic recovery and the jobs report, normalcy
bias causes people to underestimate the severity of the issue, and
overestimate the speed with which a recovery will take place.</p><p>When the
normalcy bias is too prevalent, we get situations like the one that
unfolded today wherein people who think a recovery is in full swing are
hit square in the face with the stark realities of the situation.</p><p>The
recovery will take time. A long time. Don&rsquo;t succumb to the normalcy bias
and conclude that things will return to normal with surprising
expediency. Do all you can to benefit from the recovery as it occurs. In
the meantime make sure you are investing in yourself, specifically your
transferable skills, so that when the economy is in full swing again
you will be marketable to many employers.</p><a class=hidden href=https://brid.gy/publish/mastodon></a>
