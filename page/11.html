This objective function is then used to determine which factors are important for the success of the business and therefore can result in the design of a closed-loop control system that can serve as a way to run and optimize the business. In the course of this conversation, the other person asked me if I had read The Goal, and I replied that I had not. They recommended it because it covers topics like the purpose of a business, how to find things to optimize, and what kind of process can be used for such optimization.

Although it&rsquo;s useful for getting a feeling for the scale of data challenges at a company, as a metric for the skills or effectiveness of a data organization it&rsquo;s a pretty useless topic. However, even when the topic is raised in the context of getting a feel for data challenges at a company, that only makes sense if all the data are necessary for solving problems. However, that is usually not the case and I propose that blindly collecting all possible data is an anti-pattern and bad for data programs generally. Assuming it&rsquo;s not necessary for a valid reason, like reproducibility of results, collecting all possible data can indicate that the underlying problem has not been properly identified, or that proper data governance is not in place to guide the process of collecting data.

This means things like data quality, management, risks, and similar non-technical things. It&rsquo;s comprised of the kind of concerns that business people would typically have surrounding data, although the quality topic is critically important for machine learning practitioners. For our purposes, I&rsquo;ll group the concerns generally into quality, management, and risks. Each of those things can be pursued very deeply, but we need only an overview in order to make some key points.
