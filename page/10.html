The story was that the toy list at Santa’s workshop was long, and elves had to make all the toys, with some constraints on their productivity rating and rest intervals. This is an adaptation of the classic problem of minimizing makespan, though with additional constraints. A good leaderboard position could be achieved using offline methods since the entire list of toys was supplied in advance, but as usual I pursued online solutions for fun and speed.

This view has interesting implications for the dynamics of the business in addition to how product strategy and prioritization is decided. Having worked for over 15 years in TSM environments from Online Travel, to Affiliate Marketing at Zanox, mobile ad network madvertise, and many years in Financial Services, I thought it might be useful to provide a conceptual overview of the markets, dynamics, and implications.

The move from Type 2 to Type 3 requires more focus on data and how it integrates into the product (including developing totally new products) and a departure from focusing on the data organization as a service unit.

The promise was that not having schemas would set you free and that you would become more productive, agile, your application would be faster, and all kinds of other things.

This is a general grouping of how advanced a civilization is based on the ways it utilizes energy. At the risk of reiterating what’s already on Wikipedia:
The Kardashev scale is a method of measuring a civilization’s level of technological advancement, based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to utilize.
