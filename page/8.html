While I specialize in executive advising on leadership and process, I can also dive into deep technical problems with Data Science or Software Engineering departments. Feel free to contact me directly to learn more.</p><p>I have a few tech projects in progress that will undoubtedly become blog posts. I&rsquo;m working on an e-book about leadership in organizations, as well as a field manual for triaging performance and architecture in growth-stage startups. I sometimes write code for <a href=https://github.com/adamdrake>open-source projects</a> like <a href=https://tinysite.adamdrake.com>TinySite</a> and <a href=https://compresstest.com>CompressTest</a>.

I thought it would be a nice project to create a Twitter bot that would tweet, on a given day, all the US Servicemembers killed in action on that day in prior years. You can view it on Twitter or follow @thedailyfallen directly.
I&rsquo;ve had questions before about simple Data Science, Machine Learning, and software development projects before, so here is a good example of just such a project.

They developed a product or service, matched it with a market, and are experiencing a great deal of success. During the earlier parts of this journey they were acutely aware of the possibility of competitors being able to overtake them or the reality that other competitors really were jockeying for position in the market. However, their growth rate meant that any competitors simply couldn&rsquo;t keep up.

The company was dominant in their market and were continuing to grow internationally. The person who asked me the question was intelligent and had previously worked for a large technology organization before taking on their current role leading a department. The person knew I was there to help the executive team become more effective leaders and thereby help the company continue their along their growth trajectory, but for this person leadership was seemingly a matter of delegation and punishment.

One thing which is absolutely necessary for a company to thrive is for the culture to support collaboration and a sense of shared purpose. You need unit cohesion. You need the shared feeling that we are all one group, with one purpose, currently making progress towards one goal which supports that purpose.

One thing that often comes up is looking for new jobs and how to go about that process. For more junior candidates especially, you are at risk of getting asked a very dangerous question; What is your current salary? It&rsquo;s a horrible question, and should make you pause for a moment and consider if you really want to work for the kind of company that would ask it.
