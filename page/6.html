Sometimes as a key/value store for caching, sometimes as a message queue, sometimes as a pub/sub message broker, etc. Redis is a great tool, with great performance, when used properly. However, I&rsquo;ve often seen cases where it is not used with good performance in mind, often to the detriment of system uptime and customer satisfaction. High-performance, customer-facing products literally go down for hours per day due to relatively subtle or seemingly innocent misuses of Redis.

However, I finally did set aside some time to play around with Problem 3: finding the largest prime factor of a number.
Problem Statement The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

I often see similar problems across companies when it comes to scaling up their tech teams. At a certain point, the intuitive way to grow a team breaks down, and a reorganization (&ldquo;reorg&rdquo;) is necessary in order to adopt a scalable structure. Where some companies may take months to design and execute a reorg, I prefer to handle the majority of it in about ten minutes. In this post I&rsquo;ll discuss the rationale, and introduce the major stages of the ten-minute reorg.

Until now, the answer has been a polite not yet. I simply didn&rsquo;t believe I have accumulated sufficient experience to warrant writing something from a position of authority on the topic of leadership and operations in organizations. After much consideration and gentle prodding from advisory clients, I have come to understand that my perspective may be flawed. I have long known that leaders benefit from sharing knowledge and experiences, and although I may never view myself as an authority on leadership, I can understand the value in having a summary of my philosophy available for distribution. If taking the time to share my experiences is something which can be helpful for others, then I am happy to do so.

That&rsquo;s a phrase I often keep in mind, especially when I feel my own ego getting the best of me or when I see someone else&rsquo;s ego affecting their judgment. In this context, win means making progress towards a larger strategic goal, likely by achieving some intermediate objective. So if you are playing to win and not just to be right then you are putting aside your own ego and emotional involvement in order to make progress towards a larger goal.
