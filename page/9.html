In these cases, the product might be run by a cron job, or even manually, depending on the situation. When the product is part of (more frequently, at the end of) a larger data processing pipeline, this can become inefficient or problematic since steps earlier in the pipeline can cause the product to supply incorrect information or fail altogether.

Languages like Haskell, Scala, Clojure, and others, have had huge gains in popularity and consequently there have been many large-scale projects written in some of these languages. There has also been increasing pressure to move programming more towards the rigor of mathematics, something which I strongly support.
One thing which could get more attention in the context of functional programming is the concept of Total Functional Programming, which uses the concepts of total functions combined with specific types of recursion in order to guarantee that all your programs terminate. Astute readers will note that this means, since the Halting Problem is not decidable over Turing machines, that a Total Functional Programming language is not Turing Complete. In practical use, this is not an undesirable property and in fact systems written in Turing complete languages are often restricted to be Turing incomplete by, for example, adding termination conditions to programs so that they do not run indefinitely. If you&rsquo;ve ever been working on some kind of numerical program and added something like if loopCounter > limit then return in order to stop a loop which has sufficiently converged, you have done exactly this.

The book overall expresses a nice framework for considering products and services, whether or not they should be habit-forming in the first place, and if so how to go about making that happen. The framework is very useful in that it allows for organizations to have a common language they can use to speak about their product and how they should modify or improve it. Below are my notes on a per-chapter basis, and I may follow this with another post summarizing my thoughts on the book and considerations for companies who need to add recurring users, reduce churn, and other common things.

As I participated in the Avazu competition as well, which included the use of tinrtgu&rsquo;s now-famous code, I decided to use the same approach here.
Background The overall goal of the competition is to analyze user behavior in order to generate a model for recommending ads to be shown in front of users, with the success metric being whether or not the user clicks on the ad. There is already a lot of work on this topic, so there is no need to rebuild everything from scratch.
