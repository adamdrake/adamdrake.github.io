of first price versus second price auctions. Esco Strong, the Director
of Display Marketplace Strategy for <a href=https://advertising.microsoft.com>Microsoft Advertising</a> <a href=https://www.adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/second-guessing-the-second-price-auction-model/>wrote an
article</a> that basically said second price auctions didn&rsquo;t work well for
single unit RTB auctions and we should get rid of them:</p><blockquote><p>Comparatively, first-price auctions are competitions where there is
no reduction in clearing price for the auction winner; instead, the
winner simply acquires the good they have won by paying the price of
their bid. The dynamics of this type of marketplace would become
much more straightforward and predictable, enabling more parties to
participate and experience stable results, as well as manage their
businesses to a of set expectations that won&rsquo;t require constant
revision.</p></blockquote><p>Then Jonathan Wolf, Chief Buying Officer for <a href=https://criteo.com>Criteo</a>, <a href=https://www.adexchanger.com/the-sell-sider/incentivizing-low-bidding/>wrote a
response</a> that disputed the claims made by Esco Strong:</p><blockquote><p>While I am and remain a fan of Esco, and his piece was elegantly
argued, I strongly disagree with it. As I see it, there are two
options in building a long-term business: by pricing transparently,
or by taking unfair advantage of your customers. Only the first
seems sustainable to me.</p></blockquote><p>He then went on to touch on some topics relating to first and second
price auction mechanisms with some input from the Business Intelligence
group at Criteo. The problem with Esco Strong&rsquo;s original article is that
it shows a strong lack of understanding on some critical basics of
auction theory and mechanism design. Things like the Bayes-Nash
Equilibrium, Revenue Equivalence Theorem, and construction of optimal
floor prices were not really mentioned for some reason. So, what are you
to do if you want to design an auction mechanism to participate in the
RTB space? I&rsquo;m glad you asked. The short answer is to use a sealed bid,
second price auction with a revenue-optimal reserve price. This kind of
auction is nothing new and has been around since Myerson&rsquo;s crucial 1981
paper <a href=https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos444/papers/myerson81.pdf>Optimal Auction Design</a>.</p><h3 id=revenue-equivalence-theorem>Revenue Equivalence Theorem</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to sell something and you need to know which auction
mechanism will provide you with the move revenue. There is a result in
Auction Theory dating back to Vickery in 1961 (that Myerson generalized)
that says if the auction has the following criteria:</p><ol><li><p>The bidder with the highest signal/valuation/whatever wins the
auction.</p></li><li><p>The bidder with the lowest signal/valuation/whatever expects zero
surplus (i.e., they win nothing).</p></li><li><p>All the bidders are risk-neutral.</p></li><li><p>All bids are drawn from a strictly increasing and atomless
distribution.</p></li></ol><p>then your choice of auction mechanism will not have an impact on your
revenue as the seller. As long as those conditions are met then your
choice of mechanism is not relevant to your overall revenue. <em>Bid
Shading and Revenue Volatility</em> So, why bother with any debate about
first versus second-price auctions if the revenue to the seller is
equivalent? Well, because there are some problems with using a
first-price auction. First of all, bidders don&rsquo;t have any reason to bid
their true value and instead are more motivated to engage in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid_shading>bid
shading</a>, which just means bidding slightly less than you think the
item will sell for. This kind of bidding strategy leads to more
volatility in revenue for the seller, even though the long-term revenues
would be equivalent by the Revenue Equivalence Theorem. Most of the
people in the Finance and Controlling departments don&rsquo;t really like
increased volatility in the revenue, so it&rsquo;s not so cool for them or
anyone else involved on the business side to have to deal with it.
Additionally, if you are on the buy side then you have to do all kinds
of trickery and magic in order to figure out what the true market price
is. It&rsquo;s a waste of time and energy and it doesn&rsquo;t make anybody happy.</p><h3 id=price-discrimination>Price Discrimination</h3><p>One thing that was touched on by Jonathan
Wolf was the use of what he called <em>dynamic pricing</em>, which is just a
different way of saying <em>price discrimination</em>. In theory, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination>price
discrimination</a> comes into play when you have a market for goods, the
goods cannot be transferred easily or at all after being sold, and there
is either only one place to get the goods or a few limited sources. In
this way it is possible to charge different buyers different prices for
the same item. There are different kinds of price discrimination that we
encounter in our every day lives. For example, the concept of buying in
bulk in order to pay a lower cost per unit is a standard example of
so-called <em>second degree price discrimination</em>. If you have a monopoly
on certain publishers and you are entering that inventory into an RTB
system and you also have really fantastic data analysis skills, then you
can take advantage of monopolistic effects and do things like <em>first
degree price discrimination</em>, which basically means you charge the buyer
exactly what highest price that they&rsquo;re willing to pay. However, price
discrimination may not be advisable as a long-term business strategy as
the eventual result is that people would rather do business somewhere
else than deal with your games. This leads to a discussion on . . .</p><h3 id=transparency-and-accountability>Transparency and Accountability</h3><p>Most of my experience comes from the
financial services industry, and almost all of that was in doing
consulting work for mutual funds and investment advisors in the US. This
industry is heavily regulated (although it needs more if you ask me) and
many of these regulations are designed to provide transparency and
accountability. We will need the same two things in the RTB space as
computational advertising evolves. Any company that is going to provide
an RTB system for others to participate in should be as clear as
possible about how their auction system works, the design of the
mechanism, how any conflicts of interest are handled, and so on. A lot
can be learned here from the transparency and accountability rules of
the finance space. The more transparent you are with regard to your RTB
system, the more comfortable people will be participating. When I was at
the <a href=https://www.adtrader-conference.com/en/>AdTrader Conference</a> in Hamburg last month, one of the things I
discussed with quite a few attendees was concern about and desire for
transparency in RTB systems. I can tell you all that any sort of <em>black
box</em> implementation just isn&rsquo;t going to cut it. I spoke with people from
all sides who were skeptical about participation in such an exchange.
You will have to be open and transparent about your systems (to extent
possible) if you want people to buy in and be comfortable doing business
with you. This is not some new groundbreaking business philosophy, but
some companies will be tempted to take advantage of the newness and lack
of understanding about RTB systems in order to try to make a quick buck.
You probably wouldn&rsquo;t buy or sell stocks on an exchange that didn&rsquo;t provide
transparent pricing information. So why would you try
to sell people on a black box RTB auction system?</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>So, the key takeaway here is that even though first-price and second-price
auctions generate equivalent revenue for sellers, first-price auctions
come with a lot of baggage that doesn&rsquo;t make sense to deal with. If
you&rsquo;re a buyer, then first-price auctions are a pain because you have to
employ strategies for true price determination/bid shading, and it just
adds complication. Additionally, if you are designing an RTB system,
transparency and accountability are the name of the game. Be honest
about how things work and the peace of mind your participants have will
be rewarded with loyalty.</p></div></div></section><div class="nav-box row"><div class=nav-left-menu><ul><li><a href=/>Latest</a> |</li><li><a href=/about.html>About</a> |</li><li><a href=/cases.html>Case Studies</a> |</li><li><a href=/contact.html>Contact</a> |</li><li><a href=/press.html>Press</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer-box row"><div class="footer-left col-md-6 col-xs-12"><div class="footer-bio content"><p><strong>Adam Drake</strong> leads technical business transformations in global and multi-cultural environments.
