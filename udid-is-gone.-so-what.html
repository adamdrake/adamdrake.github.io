<p>The last week has seen quite a bit of commotion in the mobile world as
Apple has started enforcing their long-awaited deprecation of the use of
the UDID. Honestly, I&rsquo;m not sure what all the fuss is about. This change
was announced by Apple last summer, so everyone has had nearly a year to
prepare for it. The general set of questions I&rsquo;ve seen on the topic can
be reduced to the following.</p>
<h3 id=why-did-apple-do-this class=anchor-link><a href=#why-did-apple-do-this>Why did Apple do this?</a></h3>
<p>Most people would simply state the the reason is related to privacy
concerns, but I think that&rsquo;s the short and easy answer. Before we can go
deeper into this question we need to consider how the UDID is typically
used by app developers and mobile advertising firms.</p>
<p>The problem with using the UDID is that, as the name implies, it is an
identifier that is unique to the device. In that sense you can think
about it like a license plate number on a car. The industry
best-practice for dealing with the UDID is to anonymize it before it
gets sent anywhere. So let&rsquo;s just say at this point that if you are
using the UDID and you aren&rsquo;t anonymizing it first, you&rsquo;re part of the
problem. Having an anonymized UDID basically akin to having some encoded
version of a license plate number from a car. This encoding is one-way
so even if you have the encoded version of the UDID, that doesn&rsquo;t mean
that you can just reverse the process to obtain the UDID itself. This
process is called hashing and the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5>MD5</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1>SHA-1</a> algorithms are the
ones most commonly used for this.</p>
<p>So what does having this anonymized identifier get you as an app
developer? Namely it allows you to see how many people have downloaded
you app, how it is being used, and various other kinds of analytics that
you may be interested in. For example, perhaps you would like to know
how often people have deleted and then re-installed your app. You can
find this out by sending the anonymized UDID every time your application
is launched. There are plenty of useful things you can measure using
this identifier from an app developer&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>The other large group that makes use of the UDID is mobile advertising
firms. One obvious use for the identifier is something like frequency
capping, which is just an industry term for making sure you don&rsquo;t see
the same ad over and over again. I think everyone is happy not to be
bothered by the same ad, especially if it isn&rsquo;t even relevant. Another
use for the UDID is for services like conversion tracking. Say you are
an advertiser and you want to run advertisements for your new app. You
also would like to know how often people are clicking on your ad, and
how often people who click on your ad are actually downloading the app,
and how many of those people are actually running the app, and so forth.
This kind of information can be obtained using the UDID. The UDID can
also be used to do so-called targeted advertising, which basically looks
at the devices who fit into some group and makes some guesses about
other devices. In other words, users who have app A and app B installed
tend to be more likely to click on advertisements for app C. This allows
for better targeting of ads and provides more efficient allocation of
resources for advertisers and more relevant advertising for users.</p>
<p>Now that the groundwork has been laid on UDIDs, how they&rsquo;re used, and
why they&rsquo;re used, we can begin to have a discussion about privacy
issues.</p>
<p>I cannot pretend to know what went on in the debates leading up to the
decision to deprecate the UDID, but here is the basic idea as I see it.
Many developers were not anonymizing the UDID before making use of it,
and this is bad no matter how you slice it. Secondly, people tend to be
uncomfortable with the idea of &ldquo;being tracked&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t have a firm
concept of what that always means. For example, if you know an
anonymized version of my license plate number, and you can&rsquo;t see
original license plate numbers, then you really don&rsquo;t have any useful
information about me. If you see my anonymized license plate in
different places on different days then you&rsquo;ll be able to re-recognize
me, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you know who I am or where I live. Lastly, the
UDID is something that is hardware based and therefore can&rsquo;t really be
changed or deleted from the device. In other words, it&rsquo;s too permanent.
All that being said, Apple didn&rsquo;t want to be seen as making it easy for
people to &ldquo;be tracked.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t blame them for that, but deprecating the
UDID doesn&rsquo;t change anything, as we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<h3 id=potential-replacements class=anchor-link><a href=#potential-replacements>Potential Replacements</a></h3>
<p>Okay, so apparently the gospel says that using the UDID is bad. What
happens next then? Well there are quite a few proposed solutions, some
of which are below in no particular order.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=https://github.com/ylechelle/OpenUDID>OpenUDID</a> is a solution that came out last year and generates a
unique token for the device that is stored in the UIPasteboard and
consequently is available to all apps. In this way it still becomes a
unique identifier for the device, which doesn&rsquo;t solve any of the
privacy problems mentioned earlier. There is some opt-out
functionality present, but the fact remains that it&rsquo;s still one
identifier that goes back to one device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=https://code.google.com/p/odinmobile/wiki/ODIN1>ODIN-1</a> uses the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address>Media Access Control</a> (MAC) address from the
wireless network chip inside the device in order to generate a unique
token for the device. In this way it is really no different than
using the UDID as it is still a hardware-based identification system
and therefore is difficult to change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=https://www.secureudid.org/>SecureUDID</a> is an effort by <a href=https://beta.crashlytics.com/>Crashlytics</a> to produce their own
UDID replacement. Apparently there is a <a href=https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/27/secureudid-is-an-open-source-solution-to-the-apple-udid-problem/>bit of a scuffle</a> between
the SecureUDID people and the OpenUDID people over who contributed to
which technology and when. In the end, the result is that you still
have a token that you can use to differentiate between devices, but
the problem is that the token is generated on a per-domain basis. In
other words, a publisher of multiple apps will be able to use the
same token in all their apps, but another publisher will not be able
to see the same token. If you are an ad network and you process ad
requests from multiple apps, then you will not be able to tell that
two requests from different apps actually came from the same device
except under very specific circumstances. In the end, this solution
is a non-starter in cases where you need to be able to identify the
same device across apps from different publishers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other solutions out there, but the last one brings us to the
key issue in the matter. The only way for the ecosystem to perpetuate is
with one unique identifier per device, and that&rsquo;s the point that is at
odds with the privacy argument. The reason that there are so many apps
available for iOS devices is because that can be a profitable endeavor.
The app developer will try to make money by selling their app for some
price, or by having some in-app advertising that generates revenue for
them. This is why apps are free. If Apple started rejecting every app
that was able to identify a device uniquely, people would be forced to
develop for other platforms, and that would be horrible for Apple.
Imagine having an iPhone or an iPad without any apps. So Apple has to
walk a fine line now by addressing concerns of privacy advocates and
also addressing concerns of those who make a living by developing apps
on their platform.</p>
<h3 id=what-next class=anchor-link><a href=#what-next>What next?</a></h3>
<p>I think most people in the industry will move towards using the
anonymized MAC address. This is the easiest change to make and the one
that is most likely to be done by most industry players. This also
allows for a device-specific identifier and therefore all of the
previous products and services that were using the UDID can convert to
using the MAC address without issue. The problem with this approach is
that it is fundamentally no different from using the UDID and therefore
likely to receive push-back from Apple at some point. In the end there
will (hopefully) be an industry-wide solution that provides the required
level of identification on a per-device basis, but is also something
that can be cleared by the user. I think that will be the best solution
for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Additionally, mobile websites and app developers should take additional
steps to clearly communicate to their users what kind of information is
being collected, why it being collected, how it will be handled, and so
forth. Additionally, opt-out capability is something that will need to
become the rule rather than the exception. This doesn&rsquo;t have to be
anything complicated, and could be as simple as app developers
displaying a Terms of Use window to the user when the app is run for the
first time. These terms should be very clear on anything related to data
collection, use, and storage, and allow the user to choose not to
provide any data at all. At that point it will be up to the
developer/publisher to decide if they want to allow the user to continue
to use the app or if they want to make the use contingent on the ability
to display ads. That&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;re making money from their trade.</p>
<h3 id=conclusion class=anchor-link><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>So the UDID is gone now. So what? This was announced months ago, and in
the end it doesn&rsquo;t really change anything. The need to uniquely identify
devices is greater than ever, and the number of apps in the iOS App
Store is rapidly growing (<a href=https://www.apple.com/iphone/built-in-apps/app-store.html>over 500,000 at the moment</a>). Apple won&rsquo;t
risk alienating their developers, who are an integral part of the reason
that people buy iOS devices in the first place (There&rsquo;s an App For
That(tm)). The goal then is to be as transparent as possible and move
toward solutions that allow users to opt out of data collection, even
though there should be no personally-identifiable information being
collected anyway. That will be the only solution to the problem of
balancing the need to uniquely identify a device and also respect the
privacy and desires of users. The downside may be that app developers
will only allow their apps to be used by those that opt in since they
need to put food on the table. Just like there is no free lunch, there
are no free apps.</p>
