When I am advising executives and leaders to help them with their teams, one of the topics of concern for them is confidence and how to gain it. Or at the very least, how to project confidence even when it&rsquo;s not there. The latter seems to be especially concerning to those who are relatively new in their leadership positions.

They were asking about their marketing function specifically, but the conversation applied more or less to all areas of the business which set targets and/or develop a budget. So basically, the whole business.
It&rsquo;s important to note that in many companies budgeting and forecasting are the same thing, so this is as much a budgeting topic as a forecasting one. The reason that a lot of departments are asked to do forecasts in the first place is simply so that the forecast can be added as a line item in a budget.

However, there are external skills which can separate effective and ineffective leaders, and communication is arguably the most fundamental of those externally-visible skills.
When a company is small, and everyone fits in a single room, then a shared vision can almost be maintained by osmosis. Additionally, at this stage a company is usually extremely focused on a narrow goal or set of goals, so there is clarity not only due to small company sizes having more efficient communication, but also because the set of objectives is small as well.

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, &mldr;
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
Classic Fibonacci problem, with a slight twist due to the summation on top. Spoiler alert: a simple loop is fastest. Keep reading to see why.

So it was with great fun that I decided to start back at the beginning with Project Euler.
One of the techniques I also use for this sort of thing is not just to solve the problem, but to really explore it. Write additional code, tests, benchmarks, and explore the underlying mathematics where practical.
