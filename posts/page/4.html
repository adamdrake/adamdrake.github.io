<h1 class=title><a href=https://adamdrake.com/on-confidence.html>On Confidence</a></h1>
<h2 class=subtitle>January 26, 2017</h2>
<div class=content>
Bearing, presence, gravitas, and authority are all some words used to describe those who project confidence. When I am advising executives and leaders to help them with their teams, one of the topics of concern for them is confidence and how to gain it. Or at the very least, how to project confidence even when it&rsquo;s not there. The latter seems to be especially concerning to those who are relatively new in their leadership positions.

<h1 class=title><a href=https://adamdrake.com/on-forecasts.html>On Forecasts</a></h1>
<h2 class=subtitle>January 26, 2017</h2>
<div class=content>
Overview I was meeting with a client recently, and since it was the end of the year and they were in their budgeting process we were discussing forecasting methodologies. They were asking about their marketing function specifically, but the conversation applied more or less to all areas of the business which set targets and/or develop a budget. So basically, the whole business.
It&rsquo;s important to note that in many companies budgeting and forecasting are the same thing, so this is as much a budgeting topic as a forecasting one.

<h1 class=title><a href=https://adamdrake.com/leadership-and-communication.html>Leadership and Communication</a></h1>
<h2 class=subtitle>January 19, 2017</h2>
<div class=content>
Good leadership is hard to quantify, especially when considering intrinsic qualities like humility (which I argue is the most important quality of all). However, there are external skills which can separate effective and ineffective leaders, and communication is arguably the most fundamental of those externally-visible skills.
When a company is small, and everyone fits in a single room, then a shared vision can almost be maintained by osmosis. Additionally, at this stage a company is usually extremely focused on a narrow goal or set of goals, so there is clarity not only due to small company sizes having more efficient communication, but also because the set of objectives is small as well.

<h1 class=title><a href=https://adamdrake.com/an-unreasonably-deep-dive-into-project-euler-problem-2.html>An Unreasonably Deep Dive into Project Euler Problem 2</a></h1>
<h2 class=subtitle>January 17, 2017</h2>
<div class=content>
First, the problem definition:
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, &mldr;
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
Classic Fibonacci problem, with a slight twist due to the summation on top.

<h2 class=subtitle>January 4, 2017</h2>
<div class=content>
Introduction As part of my work in keeping my technical skills sharp, I periodically go back to basics or solve old problems again in order to ensure my foundations are strong. So it was with great fun that I decided to start back at the beginning with Project Euler.
One of the techniques I also use for this sort of thing is not just to solve the problem, but to really explore it.

<h2 class=subtitle>September 22, 2016</h2>
<div class=content>
Those that know me are aware that I have always had great respect for people who have served or are serving in the military. I thought it would be a nice project to create a Twitter bot that would tweet, on a given day, all the US Servicemembers killed in action on that day in prior years. You can view it on Twitter or follow @thedailyfallen directly.
I&rsquo;ve had questions before about simple Data Science, Machine Learning, and software development projects before, so here is a good example of just such a project.

<h2 class=subtitle>July 30, 2016</h2>
<div class=content>
I advise many successful companies, and some of them have grown very quickly to their current size and state. They developed a product or service, matched it with a market, and are experiencing a great deal of success. During the earlier parts of this journey they were acutely aware of the possibility of competitors being able to overtake them or the reality that other competitors really were jockeying for position in the market.

<h2 class=subtitle>July 11, 2016</h2>
<div class=content>
Introduction The title of this post is literally the first question I received from someone when I was doing leadership advising at a very successful company. The company was dominant in their market and were continuing to grow internationally. The person who asked me the question was intelligent and had previously worked for a large technology organization before taking on their current role leading a department. The person knew I was there to help the executive team become more effective leaders and thereby help the company continue their along their growth trajectory, but for this person leadership was seemingly a matter of delegation and punishment.

<h2 class=subtitle>July 3, 2016</h2>
<div class=content>
Over the years I&rsquo;ve advised many companies on how to improve their leadership capabilities in order to cultivate a more effective corporate culture and thereby achieve growth. One thing which is absolutely necessary for a company to thrive is for the culture to support collaboration and a sense of shared purpose. You need unit cohesion. You need the shared feeling that we are all one group, with one purpose, currently making progress towards one goal which supports that purpose.

<h2 class=subtitle>May 5, 2016</h2>
<div class=content>
I&rsquo;ve probably hired hundreds of people in my career and I also do a fair bit of mentoring for new technology professionals, especially new Data Scientists and Data Engineers, Software engineers, and similar roles. One thing that often comes up is looking for new jobs and how to go about that process. For more junior candidates especially, you are at risk of getting asked a very dangerous question; What is your current salary?
