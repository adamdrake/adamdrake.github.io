Hypothesis (EMH) is both important and often misunderstood. For our
purposes, the term <em>efficient</em> is related to informational efficiency,
or how quickly information affects prices. In a way, the level of
informational efficiency in a market tells you what level of randomness
to expect and consequently if it is possible to outperform the market.
In its simplest form, the EMH states that market prices reflect
decisions made by participants who have acted rationally based on
information they possess. It is not required that all participants act
rationally at all times, but only that at any given time most
participants are acting rationally given the information they possess.
In order to clarify the impact of varying levels of information, the EMH
has been split into sub-types depending on what kind of information is
incorporated into the asset price. There are currently three forms of
the EMH: the Weak EMH, the Semi-strong EMH, and the Strong EMH.</p><p><strong>The Weak-form EMH</strong> stipulates that all past publicly-available information
has been accounted for in the price of an asset. It is often said that
such information is <em>priced in</em>. In this version of the EMH you can see
that if someone had new information that was not public then they could
use that information to buy or sell the stock before everyone else does
and obtain a profit. If this version of the EMH were true then there
would be numerous opportunities to outperform the market for any person
who had more information than other market participants. However, any
insider information you may obtain cannot legally be used for investment
purposes. The few people who choose not to abide by the law are
typically not enough to move the price and therefore the information
anomaly is not much of a concern. The key idea with this form of the EMH
is that past rates of return do not affect future rates of return. In
other words, rates of return for one time period are independent of
rates of return for another time period. This is an important
implication because it invalidates all forms of technical analysis
outright. Technical analysis is a method of identifying patterns in
pricing data in order to draw future conclusions about what will happen
next, but since the weak-form EMH says there are no patterns technical
analysis cannot provide any reliable information. There is a vast amount
of empirical support for this form of the EMH.</p><p><strong>The Semi-strong EMH</strong> takes the Weak EMH one step further and stipulates that not only is it
the case that all past publicly-available information is priced in to an
asset, but the price of the asset immediately corrects based on any new
publicly-available information. Because of this additional caveat, it is
impossible for investors to obtain above-market returns by acting on new
information. So on top of the concept of independent returns from the
Weak-form EMH which prevents past returns from having any effect on
future returns, we now have the additional restriction that any new
public information is effectively useless as the asset price adjust
instantaneously. The key difference between the Semi-strong EMH and the
Weak EMH is that the Semi-Strong-Form EMH also prevents someone from
consistently outperforming the market based on Fundamental Analysis in
addition to Technical Analysis.</p><p>In the <strong>Strong-form EMH</strong> all public
and private information is reflected in prices and it is impossible for
anyone to outperform the market. Since it is illegal to trade on insider
information, Strong-Form Efficiency is impossible to achieve. So what
does all this mean for performance? In a 100% efficient market, it is
impossible to outperform the market on purpose, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean
that it is impossible to outperform the market. Consider an example from
the Clustering Illusion, wherein it can be calculated that you
can expect 2,876 advisors in the US to beat the market for 5 consecutive
years on nothing but chance alone. They may advertise it as skill, and
they may genuinely believe it to be, but simply outperforming the market
for 5 consecutive years is something you expect 3.125% of advisors to
<em>always</em> do by chance. Now an important thing to consider is that with
the rise of algorithmic and high-frequency trading (HFT), markets become
increasingly efficient since machines can trade based on information
faster than humans. In this way, new information is processed and
reflected in the price of an asset faster than ever before. There have
been statements that the average holding period of securities is down to
11 seconds at some firms and while that number is an estimate, holding
periods are certainly decreasing. As holding periods decrease and
transactions in the markets increase the price action becomes more like
pure noise, i.e., totally unpredictable. That is precisely the purpose
of our market forecasts. We know that it is not possible to say with
certainty which way a stock price will move and therefore we produce
ranges wherein we believe the stock will close. This simply functions as
a <em>noise filter</em> of sorts. We don&rsquo;t claim to know what a stock will do,
only that we have a fairly good idea of what a stock is <em>unlikely</em> to
do. We know based on empirical data that a stock has approximately an
85% chance of closing within our range.</p><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>The markets
are already fairly efficient/random and are becoming more efficient as
HFT becomes more prevalent. We predict that noise filtering in markets
to become increasingly important and for this reason we strive to
provide noise filtering algorithms that are as accurate as possible.</p></div></div></section><div class="nav-box row"><div class=nav-left-menu><ul><li><a href=/>Latest</a> |</li><li><a href=/about.html>About</a> |</li><li><a href=/cases.html>Case Studies</a> |</li><li><a href=/contact.html>Contact</a> |</li><li><a href=/press.html>Press</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer-box row"><div class="footer-left col-md-6 col-xs-12"><div class="footer-bio content"><p><strong>Adam Drake</strong> leads technical business transformations in global and multi-cultural environments.
