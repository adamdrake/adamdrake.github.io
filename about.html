He has served as a White House Presidential Innovation Fellow, and is an IEEE Senior Member.</p><p>Adam&rsquo;s professional background spans a variety of industries including e-commerce, online travel, online marketing, financial services, healthcare, and oil and gas. His recognition as a Senior Member of the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) places him in the top 10% of over 400,000 members in over 160 countries.</p><p>Adam has a passion for helping companies become more productive by improving internal leadership capabilities, and accelerating product development through technology and data architecture guidance. His work in technology roles since the 90s has included a wide range of technical and leadership roles, including performing in-depth technical due-diligence and funding analysis for investors, and mentoring new technical and operational executives.</p><p>His technical interests include online learning systems, high-frequency/low-latency data processing systems, recommender systems, distributed systems, and functional programming. He has a background in Applied Mathematics.</p><h1 id=talks class=anchor-link><a href=#talks>Talks</a></h1><p>Selected talks in reverse chronological order.</p><h2 id=developing-your-ai-bs-detector-v2 class=anchor-link><a href=#developing-your-ai-bs-detector-v2>Developing Your AI BS Detector (v2)</a></h2><p>In March of 2019 I was lucky to be invited to give a lecture to Army Futures Command on AI and chose to give an updated version of my BS Detector lecture. The event was conducted in person and was also attended remotely by other commands via secure videoteleconference.</p><p>As I usually do, I have written up an <a href=https://adamdrake.com/developing-your-ai-bs-detector-v2.html>accompanying article</a> for the lecture and you can also view the <a href=https://adamdrake.com/static/talks/drake-adam-20190318-afc-developing-your-ai-bs-detector.html>corresponding slides</a> if you find them valuable.</p><h2 id=data-science-and-agile-can-or-not class=anchor-link><a href=#data-science-and-agile-can-or-not>Data Science and Agile: Can or not?</a></h2><p><a href=https://datascience.sg>Data Science Singapore</a> hosted this wonderful event alongside the <a href=https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/events/stack-2018-developer-conference>STACK conference organized by GovTech Singapore</a>. The goal was to discuss the goals of Data Science teams and Agile work and development processes and how those two areas may or may not work well together. My general opinion is that they are completely compatible, though some would argue that more structured development processes do not lend themselves to the research-focused nature of many Data Science/Machine Learning teams. It was a get discussion and crowd, and the venue was unique as well!</p><p><img class=enclosure src=/static/talks/DRAKE-adam-20181004-dssg.jpg alt="Adam speaking at Data Science Singapore"></p><h2 id=novel-results-considered-harmful class=anchor-link><a href=#novel-results-considered-harmful>Novel Results Considered Harmful</a></h2><p>For full details, see my post <a href=/novel-results-considered-harmful.html>Novel Results Considered Harmful</a></p><p>The appetite for applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been growing at an astounding rate, producing a flood of hype but only a trickle of results. In this lecture I will present a brief survey and situation report of technical needs in industry, examples of solving common problems uncommonly well, and make the case for focusing on Intelligence Amplification (IA) instead of AI. A working example of machine learning techniques in resource constrained environments will be presented, along with performance results demonstrating non-optimized training speeds of over 350,000 requests per second on a commodity laptop.</p><p><img class=enclosure src=/static/talks/DRAKE-adam-20180710-uoft.jpg alt="Adam speaking at University of Toronto"></p><p><a href=/static/talks/DRAKE-adam-20180710-novel-results-considered-harmful.html>Slides</a></p><h2 id=high-performance-machine-learning-on-a-single-node-aka-big-data-small-machine class=anchor-link><a href=#high-performance-machine-learning-on-a-single-node-aka-big-data-small-machine>High-Performance Machine Learning on a Single Node (a.k.a. Big Data, Small Machine)</a></h2><p>I was honored to be invited by <a href=https://www.meetup.com/DevTOEvents/events/250716245/>DevTO</a> to give a talk at their May meetup. The organizers were keen to have someone speak about high-performance machine learning, and I was happy to oblige.</p><p>The general thesis of the talk is that, for the purposes of machine learning, setting up large compute clusters is wholly unnecessary. Furthermore, it should generally be considered harmful as those efforts are extremely time consuming and detract from solving the actual machine learning problem at hand.</p><p>To illustrate the point, I showed an online learning approach to binary classification problems using logistic regression with adaptive learning rates.</p><p><img class=enclosure src=static/talks/DRAKE-adam-20180528-devto.jpg alt="Adam speaking at DevTO"></p><p>If you want more details, I expand on this topic in <a href=/big-data-small-machine.html>Big Data, Small Machine</a></p><h2 id=developing-your-ai-bs-detector-rational-ai-in-the-enterprise-toronto-5-april-2018 class=anchor-link><a href=#developing-your-ai-bs-detector-rational-ai-in-the-enterprise-toronto-5-april-2018>Developing Your AI BS Detector, Rational AI in the Enterprise, Toronto, 5 April 2018</a></h2><p>From the event overview page:</p><blockquote><p>Join us as an experienced lineup of AI experts share their stories from the field, cut through the AI fog and help you build a strategy to optimize your investment in machine learning projects, companies and technologies.</p><p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking to develop them as a startup or tech leader, deploy them as a business user, or fund them as an investor, you&rsquo;ll leave with key insights to help you prioritize resources towards your most valuable — and solvable — AI-powered applications.</p></blockquote><p>This event was put on by Steve O&rsquo;Neil and his team, who all did an excellent job. The venue was standing-room only with a fantastic audience of 300-400 people.</p><p>The goal of the event was to have a discussion around &ldquo;Rational AI in the Enterprise&rdquo; and I think all of the speakers did a wonderful job of doing so. We wanted to present the facts as they are, on the ground, in real-world projects and situations.</p><p>My talk was aimed at a mixed audience of technologists, investors, and executives. The goal was to instill a sense of skepticism when considering if and when a given business problem dictates an AI solution. I also sought to increase people&rsquo;s ability to have a critical conversation with someone pitching an AI solution to a business problem.</p><p><a href=/static/talks/DRAKE-adam-20180405-rational-ai.html>Download slides</a></p><p><img class=enclosure src=/static/talks/DRAKE-adam-20180405-rational-ai.jpg alt="Adam speaking in Toronto"></p><h2 id=machine-learning-with-fully-anonymized-data-machine-intelligence-toronto-14-december-2017 class=anchor-link><a href=#machine-learning-with-fully-anonymized-data-machine-intelligence-toronto-14-december-2017>Machine Learning with Fully Anonymized Data, Machine Intelligence Toronto, 14 December 2017</a></h2><p><em>Abstract:</em></p><p>Sharing data for any purposes, including for machine learning, is fraught with problems related to ethics, organizational policy and dynamics, and regulatory restrictions. In this talk I will discuss the topic of feature hashing and how, with a slight modification from the standard approach, we can satisfy many ethical and other requirements by training our models without any knowledge of the underlying data. In addition to presenting the ethical and regulatory benefits of building machine learning models using completely anonymized data, if time permits we may explore and discuss the performance characteristics and benefits of such an approach.</p><p><a href=/static/talks/DRAKE-adam-20171214-mitoronto-slides.html>Download slides</a></p><p><img class=enclosure src=/static/talks/DRAKE-adam-20171214-mitoronto.jpg alt="Adam speaking at Machine Intelligence Toronto"></p><h2 id=so-you-want-to-be-a-data-scientist-singapore-15-march-2017 class=anchor-link><a href=#so-you-want-to-be-a-data-scientist-singapore-15-march-2017>So You Want to be a Data Scientist, Singapore, 15 March 2017</a></h2><p>A panel discussion arranged by <a href=https://twitter.com/GA_Singapore>General Assembly</a> Singapore.
